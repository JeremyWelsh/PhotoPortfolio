# Photo Portfolio Website
This project is a response to social media not fulfilling my requirements in a platform to display my photos. This website will allow me to display my photos elegantly in their full aspect ratios and resolution, add collections of photos, and have my favourite photos at the forefront of the website. 

This project has taken heavy inspiration from Jason Kummerfeldt, Joe Greer, Lauren Tepfer, James Popsys, and Larry Chen's websites. These websites have minimal distractions, flow between images, high quality image files, and have the ability to view images in a larger format. These factors all play into them having a clean and appealing aesthetic while offering optimal viewing capabilities. 



## Issues with current Solutions
#### Instagram
Aspect ratios play a significant role in a how a photo is composed. On Instagram the maximum aspect ratio for posts are 1.91:1 for horizontal and 4:5 for vertical, and stories are 9:16. 



(When you share a photo that has a width between 320 and 1,080 pixels, we keep that photo at its original resolution as long as the photo's aspect ratio is between 1.91:1 and 4:5 (a height between 566 and 1,350 pixels with a width of 1,080 pixels). If the aspect ratio of your photo isn't supported, it will be cropped to fit a supported ratio.)
