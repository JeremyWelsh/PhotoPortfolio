# Photo Portfolio Website
This project is a response to social media not fulfilling my requirements in a platform to display my photos. This website will allow me to display my photos elegantly in their full aspect ratios and resolution, add collections of photos, and have my favourite photos at the forefront of the website. 

This project has taken heavy inspiration from Jason Kummerfeldt, Joe Greer, Lauren Tepfer, James Popsys, and Larry Chen's websites. These websites have minimal distractions, flow between images, high quality image files, and have the ability to view images in a larger format. These factors all play into them having a clean and appealing aesthetic while offering optimal viewing capabilities. 



## Current Solutions
### Instagram

#### Pros
Free hosting

Large existing user base

Push notifications and posts


#### Cons
Aspect ratios play a significant role in a how a photo is composed. On Instagram the maximum aspect ratio for posts are 1.91:1 for horizontal and 4:5 for vertical, and stories are 9:16 (https://help.instagram.com/1631821640426723). 

Grid view of all photos on an account is limited to 1:1 aspect ratio for each photo and does not include Instagram Stories. The only way to re-organize a grid view is by deleting an reposting photos, however this would become irritating to anyone following the page as they may see large amounts of reposts in their feeds.

Galleries of photos not being able to be viewed all at once if you were to post them in all in one post. also being hidden from the grid view.

Social media aspect - putting a value on photos based on likes

Does not exclusively require an account to view, but gives a worse user experience for those without an account or app.
