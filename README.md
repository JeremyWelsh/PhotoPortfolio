# Photo Portfolio Website
This project is a response to social media not fulfilling my requirements in a platform to display my photos. This website will allow me to display my photos elegantly in their full aspect ratios and resolution, add collections of photos, and have my favourite photos at the forefront of the website. 

This project has taken heavy inspiration from Jason Kummerfeldt, Joe Greer, Lauren Tepfer, James Popsys, and Larry Chen's websites. These websites have minimal distractions, flow between images, high quality image files, and have the ability to view images in a larger format. These factors all play into them having a clean and appealing aesthetic while offering optimal viewing capabilities. 

## Current Design of the website

## Existing Solutions
### Instagram

#### Pros
Instagram has some great features for photographers to display their images. One of these features is free hosting, A user only has to create an account and they can immediately upload an image and share to others. As Instagram has over a billion users, it is likely that anyone who they share photos with can easily access their photos.

Instagram pushes new posts to followers feeds allowing them to keep up to date with a users recent posts. This is a great way of keeping followers in the loop, but as will be mentioned in the Cons section, this can also cause issues when sorting images in an account's grid.


#### Cons
Aspect ratios play a significant role in a how a photo is composed. On Instagram the maximum aspect ratio for posts are 1.91:1 for horizontal and 4:5 for vertical, and stories are 9:16. 

Grid view of all photos on an account is limited to 1:1 aspect ratio for each photo and does not include Instagram Stories. The only way to re-organize a grid view is by deleting an reposting photos, however this would become irritating to anyone following the page as they may see large amounts of reposts in their feeds.

Galleries of photos not being able to be viewed all at once if you were to post them in all in one post. also being hidden from the grid view.

Social media aspect - putting a value on photos based on likes

Does not exclusively require an account to view, but gives a worse user experience for those without an account or app.
